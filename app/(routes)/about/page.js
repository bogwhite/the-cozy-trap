            Our eight cozy cabins provide a comfort base for your vacation, but
            it&apos;s in the surrounding mountains where you&apos;ll find true
            tranquility and freedom. Walking through the dense forests,
            breathing in the fresh mountain air, watching the stars twinkle -
            all this will be part of your experience. You can enjoy this beauty
            around the fireplace or in a hot tub in the open air.

            life, relax and feel the joy of being together in beautiful

            hustle and bustle and enjoy time with your loved ones in the true
            tranquility of nature.
